# S120 Kowata The Person Class
This is a project that demonstrates my understanding of classes and how they can be applied to managing a database. Topics covered are copy-constructors, overloading operators, encapsulation, file management, and destructors. I will update it as I cover more topics in class. 

Recently Added:

->new student class that inherits from person class

->student database that reads from a file (note: will add the database information later on)
