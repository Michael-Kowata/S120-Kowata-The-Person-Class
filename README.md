# S120 Kowata The Person Class
This is a project that demonstrates my understanding of classes and how they can be applied to managing information in a vector database. Topics covered are copy-constructors, overloading operators, encapsulation, file management, destructors, and inheritence. I will update it as I cover more topics in class. 

Recently Added:

->new chef class 

->chef database that reads from a file 

->a map and multimap that asks the user for specific idenifiying key to find a specific chef (based on their id and orders)
